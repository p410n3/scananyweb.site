# DEPRECATED AND UNMAINTAINED PROJECT

(Also proably unsafe, I was a big noob back then)

Live version on https://scananyweb.site

As someone who helps people mananging their webservers and websites for some extra cash, I decided to build a Webinterface for some tools I often use as alaways SSH-ing into my Server got annoying. You can pretty much use this with any Shell programm on linux. 

My Server is currently running on Debian 8. 

You obviously need to install the included tools first.

Only index.html and the scan.php are included. Create the rest by yourself!
